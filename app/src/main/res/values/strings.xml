To get the most out of it:\n\nSet Aside Dedicated Time: Find a quiet and comfortable space where you can sit or lie down without distractions. Dedicate a specific time each day for your stress relief meditation practice.\n\nBody Scan: Start by taking a few deep, calming breaths. Then, perform a body scan.

Aim to make it a daily or regular part of your routine, especially during stressful times.\n\nExtend Mindfulness: As you go about your day, try to carry the mindfulness and relaxation you cultivate in your meditation into your daily activities.
